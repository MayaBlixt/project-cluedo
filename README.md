# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project main goals was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo that randomly should generate killer, weapon and a room. 

## The problem

As most of the design was set from the begin the first approach was to understand the predefined css, html and js code.
Three clickable cards where used to generate a radom killer, weapon and room.
The DOM was used to present killer, weapon to the user and and a clickable button that reveald the crime updating the DOM.
To store killer and weapon information I created js objects that were put in to arrays and rooms where only stored in an array.
 The styling was also updated with background image, opacity on decks plus icons for killer, weapon and rooms where added.
Styling for the Reaveal crime button was updated with hover animations.     

If I had more time I would have added a favoriteWeapon and created a loading animation.
